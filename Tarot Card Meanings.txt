Interpretation Note: Tarot meanings vary by deck, reader, or context (e.g., position in a spread). Upright meanings emphasize the card’s core energy, while reversed meanings often indicate blocked, excessive, or opposite expressions of that energy. Yes/No/Maybe assignments are based on typical interpretations for yes-or-no questions but can shift with context, question phrasing, or spread position.
